Hello! I recently had to change the visibility of this repo for my class, but here are some other projects I've also completed:

This is a C++ program that estimates sine, cosine, and tangent using the Macluarin series for each:
https://github.com/samuelSchulthies/maclaurinEstimator

A couple Python scripts that build a train in Maya when pasted and executed in the Maya script editor:
https://github.com/samuelSchulthies/mayaTrain

This C++ project demonstrates a binary tree structure by traversing a self-balancing AVL tree:
